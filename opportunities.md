## Opportunities

We are seeking graduate students at the master and the PhD level for different projects described in the Research section. We look for motivated students interested by community ecology, spatial ecology and biodiversity. We expect candidates with strong skills in modeling, mathematics and programming for the most theoretical aspects of our research program, and autonomous students, with interest in lab work (especially with invertebrate taxonomy and/or microbiology) and in statistics for the empirical aspects of the program.

We encourage students to develop their own research project within the different research axis of the Chair. Because science is first about innovation, we look for creative students with a conceptual approach of ecology.

Students interested in conducting graduate studies at the Chair should send their CV, a copy of transcripts and a short statement of their research interest to <a href="mailto:dominique.gravel@usherbrooke.ca">dominique.gravel@usherbrooke.ca</a>

### Graduate program at Sherbrooke University

Two graduate programs with several specialities are available to students interested in conducting studies with the Chair:

- [Ph.D. degree in Biology](http://www.usherbrooke.ca/programmes/sec/sciences-de-la-vie/troisieme-cycle/doctorats/doctorat-en-biologie/)
- [Msc. degree in Biology](http://www.usherbrooke.ca/programmes/sec/sciences-de-la-vie/deuxieme-cycle/maitrises/maitrise-en-biologie/)


## Open positions

### FULLY-FUNDED PHD POSITION ON SPECIES RANGE MODELLING AND KEY BIODIVERSITY AREAS

We are looking for a graduate student with a strong background in statistics or modelling to undertake a PhD project whose main objective is to develop species distribution models. The PhD will be completed as part of the Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) identification process coordinated by the Wildlife Conservation Society Canada. The student will be based at the Université de Sherbrooke (Québec) and will join the Computational Biodiversity Science and Services (BIOS²) training program.

Supervisors: Dominique Gravel (UdeS) and Ciara Raudsepp-Hearne (WCS)

Beginning of studies: summer or fall 2020

Funding: Fellowship of $ 20000 CAD per year for 4 years
