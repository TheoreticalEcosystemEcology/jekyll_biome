## Opportunities

We are seeking graduate students at the master and the PhD level for different projects described in the Research section. We look for motivated students interested by community ecology, spatial ecology and biodiversity. We expect candidates with strong skills in modeling, mathematics and programming for the most theoretical aspects of our research program, and autonomous students, with interest in lab work (especially with invertebrate taxonomy and/or microbiology) and in statistics for the empirical aspects of the program.

We encourage students to develop their own research project within the different research axis of the Chair. Because science is first about innovation, we look for creative students with a conceptual approach of ecology.

Students interested in conducting graduate studies at the Chair should send their CV, a copy of transcripts and a short statement of their research interest to <a href="mailto:dominique.gravel@usherbrooke.ca">dominique.gravel@usherbrooke.ca</a>

### Graduate program at Sherbrooke University
